# Async_fifo
Verilog implementation of Asynchronous FIFO using gray coding and two flop synchronizer

Verilog code of Asynchronous FIFO.

Asynchronous FIFO :
Depth       = 64 (hence Address width = 6 bits)
Data width  = 16 bits
Gray code pointer for 2-flop synchronization
Binary code pointer for addressing

"Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design" by Clifford E. Cummings, Sunburst Design, Inc. was referred for the designs. Going through the document is highly recommended.
